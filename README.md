# Spacebar Kiosk

Customer-facing Raspberry Pi touchscreen kiosk for creating unpaid drink orders
in tillweb. The kiosk shows stock for one configured till location, sends the
basket to tillweb, prints the returned unpaid order slip locally, and shows the
customer the order ref to take to a human-operated till.

> Screenshots taken in mock mode (`KIOSK_MOCK_MODE=true`). Run `npm start` with those env vars to reproduce locally.

## Runtime Shape

- A Node.js server serves the kiosk UI on localhost (one runtime dependency: `qrcode` for slip generation). Slip printing is complete — ESC/POS + QR raster via `src/slip.js`. **Outstanding before site:** slip logo artwork (`logoBytes()` in `slip.js` currently returns an empty buffer — add the Polybius/Space Bar logo bitmap there), and a physical test print on the U220A to verify QR scale.
- The browser never sees the tillweb bearer token; the local server proxies API
  calls to tillweb.
- Slips print through CUPS using `lp` by default.
- Raspberry Pi kiosk mode is handled with systemd services for the server and
  Chromium.
- The UI is designed for a portrait touchscreen, with products above and the
  running basket plus `Confirm order` action fixed at the bottom of the screen.

## Local Development

```sh
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env
npm start
```

For local UI work without a printer, set:

```sh
KIOSK_PRINT_ENABLED=false
KIOSK_MOCK_MODE=true
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Raspberry Pi Install

On Raspberry Pi OS with Node.js 20+, Chromium, CUPS, and a configured printer:

```sh
sudo ./ops/install-pi.sh
sudoedit /etc/spacebar-kiosk.env
sudo systemctl restart spacebar-kiosk.service spacebar-kiosk-browser.service
```

Required settings:

- `TILLWEB_BASE_URL`: tillweb base URL, such as `https://till.example.org`.
- `TILLWEB_KIOSK_TOKEN`: bearer token from `emftillweb`'s
  `[kiosk.tokens]` configuration.
- `KIOSK_LOCATION`: tillweb stock/order location, default `spacebar`.

Useful optional settings:

- `KIOSK_PRINTER_NAME`: CUPS printer name. Blank uses the default printer.
- `KIOSK_PRINT_COMMAND`: `lp` or `lpr`.
- `KIOSK_PORT`: local HTTP port, default `8080`.

Remote operations — required if the kiosk is unattended:

- `KIOSK_OMS_URL`: base URL of the OMS server (e.g. `http://192.168.x.x:8081`). When set, printer errors are POSTed to `/api/printer-alert` so the OMS staff screen can alert bar staff. If not set, printer failures are visible on the kiosk screen but invisible to staff. Requires that the kiosk can reach the OMS server — confirm camp-network → VLAN routing with Luke before site.
- `KIOSK_LISTEN_HOST`: host to bind the local server, default `127.0.0.1`. Set to `0.0.0.0` if you need the kiosk UI reachable from another device.
- `KIOSK_DUMMY_PRINT`: if `true`, renders the slip to a file in `/tmp` instead of sending to CUPS. Useful for testing slip layout without a printer; auto-enabled in mock mode when `KIOSK_PRINT_ENABLED=true`.

## Operations

Check status:

```sh
systemctl status spacebar-kiosk.service
systemctl status spacebar-kiosk-browser.service
```

Read logs:

```sh
journalctl -u spacebar-kiosk.service -f
journalctl -u spacebar-kiosk-browser.service -f
```

Health check:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz
```

## Customer Flow

Customers tap drinks to add them to the running basket at the bottom of the
screen, adjust quantities there, then press `Confirm order`. The kiosk creates
an unpaid order in tillweb, prints the order slip, and shows the order number.

If stock changes while the customer is ordering, the kiosk refreshes the product
list and asks them to review the basket. If the order is created but printing
fails, the kiosk shows a staff/help state and does not create another order.

## Product Images and Metadata

Category tabs are derived automatically from the quicktill **department** field
on each stocktype — no configuration needed. To change which tab a product
appears under, change its department in quicktill.

Per-product display overrides are configured in `public/products.json`. Two
ways to match a product:

- **By stockline ID** (numeric keys): exact match on quicktill
  `stockline.id`. Wins over name matching.
- **By name** (the `names` map): case-insensitive substring match against the
  product name. This is what ships by default — it survives stockline
  renumbering between events, so art stays attached no matter what IDs the
  till assigns. First matching key wins; keep specific keys ("nice fizz")
  before generic ones.

```json
{
  "42": { "image": "/images/products/some-beer.jpg", "category": "Craft Beer" },
  "43": { "model": "ball", "color": "#1e90ff" },
  "names": {
    "sea change": { "category": "Canned Wine", "label": "Sea Change", "color": "#9fcfe8" }
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `image` | URL of a product image. Put files in `public/images/products/` and reference as `/images/products/filename.jpg`. Recommended: at least 400 × 280 px (card image area is 140 px tall). Setting an image replaces the 3D model for that product. |
| `category` | Overrides the quicktill department for tab assignment. Useful if the till department names don't match what you want shown on the kiosk, or to split one department across multiple tabs. |
| `model` | Overrides the 3D model shape: `can`, `ball` (BuzzBallz), or `bottle`. By default it's inferred from the name/category. |
| `color` | Overrides the 3D model colour (any CSS colour, e.g. `#1e90ff`). By default it's guessed from the flavour in the product name. |
| `color2` | Optional second colour for a two-tone can: bottom 2/3 uses `color2`, top 1/3 uses `color`. "& Coke" mixers get this automatically (cola-brown body, spirit-coloured top band). |
| `label` | Text baked onto can models as the wordmark, like the BuzzBallz logo on the balls (which is built in and needs no config). Defaults to the product name up to the first "&" (so "Jack Daniel's & Coca-Cola" reads "Jack Daniel's"). |
| `logo` | URL of a logotype image (SVG/PNG) baked onto the can in place of the text label, tinted to a flat contrast colour. Falls back silently to `label` while the file doesn't exist, so entries can be pre-wired. |
| `logo2` | Secondary mark drawn smaller below the primary — e.g. the Coca-Cola script under the Jack Daniel's wordmark on the co-branded can. |

All fields are optional. Products without an entry show a bobbing low-poly 3D
model (colour and shape inferred from the name/category) and use the quicktill
department as their category.

### 3D product models

Each card shows a small, cheap low-poly model that bobs and spins (`public/scene.js`).
Models are built procedurally — there are no asset files to manage. three.js is
vendored at `public/vendor/three.module.js` so the kiosk renders fully offline.

The renderer is tuned for the Raspberry Pi: one shared WebGL context for the whole
grid, no antialiasing, flat-shaded materials, ~2 meshes per model, 30 fps, and
off-screen cards are skipped. It pauses entirely on the sleep and confirmation
screens. If WebGL is unavailable it falls back silently to an empty card.

Stockline IDs come from the quicktill database (`stockline.id`).

### Brand logotypes

`products.json` is pre-wired to look for real logotype files in
`public/images/brands/` — cans show the plain text wordmark until a file
exists, then pick up the logotype automatically (tinted to a flat contrast
colour, so any source colours work). Drop in SVGs with these names:

| File | Product(s) | Suggested source |
|---|---|---|
| `jack-daniels.svg` | JD & Coca-Cola | Wikimedia Commons "Jack Daniel's logo" |
| `coca-cola.svg` | JD & Coca-Cola (secondary mark) | Commons "Coca-Cola logo.svg" |
| `smirnoff.svg` | Smirnoff & Cola | Commons "Smirnoff logo" |
| `captain-morgan.svg` | Captain Morgan & Pepsi Max | Commons "Captain Morgan logo" |
| `pepsi-max.svg` | Captain Morgan & Pepsi Max (secondary) | Commons "Pepsi MAX logo" |
| `tanqueray.svg` | Tanqueray G&T | Commons "Tanqueray logo" |
| `nice.svg` | Nice canned wines | nicedrinks.com press kit |
| `sea-change.svg` | Sea Change 0% | seachangewine.com press kit |

Most classic wordmarks on Commons are tagged `PD-textlogo` (plain typography
is not copyrightable); they remain trademarks, used here to identify the
genuine products sold at the bar. Prefer plain wordmark variants over crest /
emblem versions — emblems can carry copyright, and they tint less cleanly.

The mock catalogue in `src/server.js` mirrors the planned site stock
(8 BuzzBallz flavours, 4 premix RTD cans, 4 canned wines), so mock mode
exercises the full backend → model mapping end to end.

## Tillweb API

The kiosk server fetches products from the public EMF stockline API:

```text
GET /api/stocklines.json?output=full&type=continuous&location=<location>
```

It creates unpaid saved orders through the private kiosk API:

```text
POST /api/kiosk/orders.json
POST /api/kiosk/orders/expire.json
```

The private API still uses a bearer token. The browser UI never sees that token;
only the local Node.js server sends it to tillweb.
